Ultra-fast Non-invasive Fetal aneupLOidy Detection - UNFOLD

This is the original code I wrote at Novogene for analyzing maternal peripheral blood for detecting fetal chromosomal aneuploidy (Trisomy 21, Trisomy 18 and Trisomy 13). 
This program runs really fast (about 11 seconds per 300M size sample) for a simple fast mapping algorithm and using a system shared memory reference method.
